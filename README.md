When I was a kid, I had both dogs and cats at home. Then, after becoming independent and living alone, I wanted to raise a pet, 
so I raised a cat because there was a chance to get a cat, and I thought that it was much easier for me to raise a cat than a dog. 
Of course, it depends on the dog or cat, but based on my experiences so far, the five reasons why I love cats better than dogs are as follows.

  1. Cats are cleaner
  2. Cats are quiet
  3. Cats sleep a lot
  4. Cats do not bother
  5. It's comfortable when eating

Dogs are extremely lovable. It makes me happier to be around them. I treat them not just as pets, but as members of my family. My furkids never leave me alone. They were always there for me, no matter what. They can tell if I am upset. Dogs did not abandon you, which is why they are known as man's best friend. 

1. Dogs are loyal companion
2. Dogs are good family pet
3. Dogs are affectionate and gentle
4. Dogs are smart and intelligent
5. Dogs are selfless
