Then, after becoming independent and living alone, I wanted to raise a pet, so I raised a cat because there was a chance to get a cat, and I thought it was much easier for me to raise a cat than a dog. Of course, it depends on the dog or cat, but based on my experiences so far, the five reasons why I love cats better than dogs are as follows.
