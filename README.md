When I was a kid, I had both dogs and cats at home. Then, after becoming independent and living alone, I wanted to raise a pet, so I raised a cat because there was a chance to get a cat, and I thought that it was much easier for me to raise a cat than a dog. Of course, it depends on the dog or cat, but based on my experiences so far, the five reasons why I love cats better than dogs are as follows.

  1. Cats are cleaner
  2. Cats are quiet
  3. Cats sleep a lot
  4. Cats do not bother
  5. It's comfortable when eating
